# Animated-Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku solver with animation to show progress

A mobile app based on Flutter to help solve Sudoku

Instead of just showing the solution, the app displays progress as it solves using basic techniques and finally, if required, dlx algorithm.

The app uses basic techniques such as searching for singles and naked pairs. If someone wants to add other techniques such as hidden pairs, triples, swordfish, etc., please do so.

How to build:

1. Install flutter and associated dependencies.
2. Install your choice of IDE, VSCode or Android Studio.
3. Create a new fluter app using the IDE. This will create a Hello World type basic app.
4. Run the app with an emulator or on your phone to check that everything is working.
5. Replace all files in the lib directory of the newly created app with the files from lib directory of this repo.
